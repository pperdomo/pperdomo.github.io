I would like the focus of my presentation to be on how soccer was influential in my life growing up. 
That will then lead to women's soccer in general and I will use the United States Women's National Soccer 
Team rise to the World Cup victory to drive my point home. I want to show the audience that women's soccer 
is just as skilled and as entertaining to watch as men's soccer. There is a lot of injustices and 
discrepancies when it comes to the varying teams and I want to show people that they need to pay more 
attention to the talented women of the sport. There has been a lot of empathy when it comes to this so it 
would be great to pique some people's interest in women's soccer. This is my topic of choice because it is 
something that interests me and is close to my heart. I grew up playing myself and also experiencing how unfair 
it was that most people focus on males when we have the best female soccer team in the world.
